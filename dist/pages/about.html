        <section class="about-content">
            <p>Up to this moment it might seem like one of the many stories of entrepreneurship in the digital age. But the three young founders of last77.org are together not only because of their shared vision, but also because of all the things they manage to do together. Their age range varies from 25 to 39 years old, and they all carry different ideas, passions and interests. One excels in technology, the second one has strong design sensitivity while the younger one is into user experience. To each his own, but their real strength is their team.</p>

            <h2>Not to please everyone, but to communicate with everyone.</h2>
            <p>Their objective is not to sell products, but to create a feeling of well-being in digital spaces, public platforms, and finally homes. Why? Because they didn't think about it at first, but in the process of creating things that reflect themselves, they ended up with a collection which is: fluid, adaptable, spontaneous. They enjoy staying in the office as much as they like to stay at home, to stay with the team as much as with their family, and their collection reflects this.</p>

            <h2>The search for the special, in the normality of everyday things.</h2>
            <p>Our ambition is to make true things, the kind of digital experiences that remain in time, that do not follow trends, that generate good memories and make you feel at ease. Pure is the value that we would like to convey; a company whose solidity is given by simple things: shared values, the joy in sharing successes and challenges, the concreteness of doing, the will to keep a chain of digital craftsmen whose products are coordinated with the best contemporary technologies.</p>

            <h2>Extraordinary? No, but extra-ordinary yes.</h2>
            <p>We do not consider ourselves special, but genuinely want to live a life full of excitement, experiences, innovations and experiments. A special life, but a real one. And in being true and concrete, it can be extraordinary every day. We are reminded of this by the collaborative tools on our desktops or the virtual walls we use as mood boards, not to mention the digital workspace we have transformed into a kitchen of ideas, leaving it within reach of all our guests or collaborators.</p>

            <p class="quote">Because a moment more joyful than creating together is innovating together.</p>

            <p>Yes, sharing is part of our DNA. Also, if among brothers you don't share you don't survive, and this life lesson has served us well in business management. A team, even before colleagues; some like to call it extended family, but it is always better to surround yourself with friends than just relatives. So be it: last77.org is a close-knit group of people who have become friends, driven by passion before by work.</p>
